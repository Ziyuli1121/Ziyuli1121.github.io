Hi! I’m Ziyu (Perry) Li, a junior at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign majoring in Mathematics (Data Optimization Concentration).

I'm passionate about applying novel machine learning and AI techniques to solve challenges in synthetic biology and protein engineering. I currently work as an undergraduate researcher in the [Zhao Group @ UIUC](https://zhaogroup.chbe.illinois.edu), advised by [Dr. Huimin Zhao](https://chbe.illinois.edu/people/profile/zhao5), where I develop deep learning models for challenging protein engineering tasks. I am mainly focusing on **graph-based protein representation**, **multi-modal co-contrastive learning in non-Euclidean space**, and **biological knowledge graph**.

I'm a James Scholar and have been on the Dean’s List every semester.

Beyond academics, I serve as an Education Lead for the [Illinois Data Science Club](https://linktr.ee/illinoisdatascienceclub?utm_source=linktree_profile_share&ltsid=c5e4ec89-c19e-4700-b923-b4281395ea35), where I design curriculum resources, organize workshops, and support members in learning data science through hands-on projects.

I am currently preparing to apply for PhD programs starting in Fall 2026. I am particularly interested in **unified multimodal fusion**, **manifold optimization**, **generative protein design**, **bio-AI synergy**, and **collaborative interdisciplinary innovation**.

In my free time, I have been playing the piano for over 15 years, and you might also find me on the soccer field.
